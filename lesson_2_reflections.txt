What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git file which is used to track all the metadata about your repository.
If you didn't have this file, then it would just be treated like a normal directory
and wouldn't have any version control features.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What
value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary stage between the working directory and the repo.
It lets you organize your commit before you actually commit it.
