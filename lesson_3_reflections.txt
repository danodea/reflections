When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

From what I have heard and read, the answer is "pretty much always".  Getting your work
out there and sharing it with others is a great way to connect with people.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The main reason is that you don't want git to pull things that aren't finished yet, or
that you aren't yet ready to share.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

Clones and forks are similiar in that they both copy a repository from one location to
another.  The difference is that clone is a git command used to copy something from a
remote to local, or from local to local, and fork is a github command used to copy from
one github account to another.  Branches create a new chain of commits within an existing
repo, and are used for many different reasons.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work on it offline!


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would
be harder?

You would have to manually pass save files around via email or something.  That would be a
big pain.  I can't really think of any ways that would be easier.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

Making changes in a separate branch is useful when you are building new features, making
experimental changes, etc, but you still want to have a useable "prodcution" branch, aka
master.  It might make more sense to do everything in master during early development.
